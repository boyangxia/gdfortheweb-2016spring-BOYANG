		<p class="textbox">Do you find your audience to be mostly geeks?

		<div class="shape1 fontfamily"></div>

		<p class="textbox">I hope not! I am not really trying to speak to the geeks with my work, but I appreciate their interest in it. One of my aims is to demystify technology and make it seem approachable, transparent, humble. I try not to impress with complexity, magic and opaque glossy touch surfaces. In that way, the work should really speak to anybody, not just the technically inclined.

		What about you? Who would say is the main audience of your web-based pieces? Is there a clear demographic across the people who buy/collect your works?</p>

		<div class="shape fontfamily"></div>

		<p class="textbox">My web audience is huge. It’s almost 50 million visits per year. I don’t know who these people are. Some are accidental visits, who happen to find my work when they Google the word “Toilet Paper.” Others follow my work for years.

		<br>.<br>.<br>.<br><br>

		As far as my collectors, they are not geeky at all, they just respond to my work and they like the challenge of owning a website as part of their art collection. I’m hoping at some point the startup/software/tech community will be into the idea of collecting art websites. They would be really good at preserving the works in the long run.</p>
